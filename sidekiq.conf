# /etc/init/sidekiq.conf - Sidekiq config

# Modified from: https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/master/examples/upstart/manage-one/sidekiq.conf
#
# This script allows you to manage multiple Sidekiq instances with
# Upstart, Ubuntu's native service management tool.
#
# Save this config as /etc/init/sidekiq.conf then mange sidekiq with:
#   sudo start sidekiq index=0
#   sudo stop sidekiq index=0
#   sudo status sidekiq index=0
#
# or use the service command:
#   sudo service sidekiq {start,stop,restart,status}
