Hailstorm 5.0.0 is out with new features and a new distribution format.

## New Web User Interface
Hailstorm 5.0.0 features a whole new user interface that is fast and hopefully, intuitive. The Web UI enables you to:

- Manage multiple performance testing projects.
- Execute tests across the Amazon Clouds and your own data centers.
- Generate and store reports.
- Create low cost clusters for load generation on EC2 with the in-built cost calculator.

## Other Improvements

- Load generating EC2 instances are always launched in a VPC. By default, a Hailstorm specific VPC is created for easier maintainence
  by an Ops team.

- Enhanced calculator for suggesting the maximum number of threads for a selected instance.

## Distribution Format

**Docker** is used to distribute the different components and **Docker Compose** is used to set up a single command deploy for the
Web UI as well as the CLI. Installing Hailstorm has never been easier than this.
