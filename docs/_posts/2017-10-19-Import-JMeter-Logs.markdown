A new feature to import JMeter log files generated outside of Hailstorm is now available from the CLI. This gives
you the ability to use Hailstorm for only its reporting capabilities.

You can read all about it on the Wiki page - [Import Results](https://github.com/3pillarlabs/hailstorm-sdk/wiki/Import-Results)
