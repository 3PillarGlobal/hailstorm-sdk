The latest release of **Hailstorm** adds the following features:

- A notification system that notifies the user of the status of their actions in the application.

- Error and warning messages displayed in the log stream are additionally shown
  with notifications. These notifications stay till the user dismisses them. This is
  helpful when a log message scrolls up outside of the viewport.
