- [Bug 1] Web - default instance type in SPA works only in VPC.
- [Bug 2] Web - without any projects, the project listing page spinner spins forever. Expect to move to New Project dialog.
- [Bug 3] Gem - sometimes logs fail to download from the Web interface (exception is in a thread making it hard to track down); but there's no apparent issue.
- [Bug 4] CLI - ``results`` fails in random ways if log collection was not successful for some reason when tests are stopped. Seems to be related to [Bug 3](Bug 3).
- [Task 5] Web - optimize react effects (too many triggered for false positives)
