help_options: |
  Hailstorm shell accepts commands and associated options for a command.

  Commands:

  setup           Boot up load agents and setup target monitors.

  start           Starts load generation and target monitoring.

  stop            Stops load generation and target monitoring.

  abort           Aborts load generation and target monitoring.

  terminate       Terminates load generation and target monitoring.

  results         Include, exclude, export, import results or generate report

  purge           Purge specific or ALL data from database

  show            Show the environment configuration

  status          Show status of load generation across all agents

  help COMMAND    Show help on COMMAND
                  COMMAND help will also show help on COMMAND

setup_options: |
  Boot load agents and target monitors.
  Creates the load generation agents, sets up the monitors on the configured
  targets and deploys the JMeter scripts in the project "jmeter" directory
  to the load agents.

  Options

  force       Force application setup, even when no environment changes
              are detected.

start_options: |

  Starts load generation and target monitoring. This will automatically
  trigger setup actions if you have modified the configuration. Additionally,
  if any JMeter plan is altered, the altered plans will be re-processed.
  However, modified datafiles and other support files (such as custom plugins)
  will not be re-deployed unless the redeploy option is specified.

  Options

  redeploy      Re-deploy ALL JMeter scripts and support files to agents.

stop_options: |
  Stops load generation and target monitoring.
  Fetch logs from the load agents and server. This does NOT terminate the load
  agents.

  Options

  wait          Wait till JMeter completes.
  suspend       Suspend load agents (depends on cluster support).

abort_options: |
  Aborts load generation and target monitoring.
  This does not fetch logs from the servers and does not terminate the
  load agents. This task is handy when you want to stop the current test
  because you probably realized there was a misconfiguration after starting
  the tests.

  Options

  suspend       Suspend load agents (depends on cluster support).

terminate_options: |
  Terminates load generation and target monitoring.
  Additionally, cleans up temporary state information on local filesystem.
  You should usually invoke this task at the end of your test run - although
  the system will allow you to execute this task at any point in your testing
  cycle. This also terminates the load agents.

results_options: |
  Show, include, exclude or generate report for one or more tests. Without any
  argument, all successfully stopped tests are operated on. The optional TEST
  argument can be a single test ID or a comma separated list of test IDs(4,7)
  or a hyphen separated list(1-3). The hyphen separated list is equivalent to
  explicitly mentioning all IDs in comma separated form.

  Options

  show    [TEST]  Displays successfully stopped tests (default).
          last    Displays the last successfully stopped tests
  exclude [TEST]  Exclude TEST from reports.
                  Without a TEST argument, no tests will be excluded.
  include [TEST]  Include TEST in reports.
                  Without a TEST, no tests will be included.
  report  [TEST]  Generate report for TEST.
                  Without a TEST argument, all successfully stopped tests will
                  be reported.
  export  [TEST]  Export the results as one or more JTL files.
                  Without a TEST argument, all successfully stopped tests
                  will be exported.
  import  <FILE>  Import the results from FILE(.jtl). OPTS is a set of
          [OPTS]  key value pairs, specified as key=value and multiple pairs
                  are separated by whitespace. Known keys and when they are
                  needed:
                  jmeter=<plan name>     # required if there are multiple plans
                  cluster=<cluster code> # required if there are multiple clusters
                  exec=<test id>         # required if the data is to be imported
                                           to an existing test cycle. `test id` is
                                           the first column of the table displayed
                                           by 'results'

show_options: |
  Show how the environment is currently configured. Without any option,
  it will show the current configuration for all the environment components.

  Options

  jmeter        Show jmeter configuration
  cluster       Show cluster configuration
  monitor       Show monitor configuration
  active        Show everything active (default)
  all           Special switch to show inactive items
                > show all
                > show jmeter all

purge_options: |
  Purge  (remove) all or specific data from the database. You can invoke this
  command anytime you want to start over from scratch or remove data for old
  tests. If executed without any options, will only remove data for tests.

  WARNING: The data removed will be unrecoverable!

  Options

  tests         Purge the data for all tests (default)
  clusters      Purge the cluster information and artifacts.
                Outcome depends on the type of the cluster, for Amazon,
                this means ALL Hailstorm related infrastructure for the
                account will be deleted. This is a bad idea if you are using
                a shared account, harmless otherwise, since all required
                infrastructure is created on-demand. It is recommended to
                use this command _only_ when suggested by diagnostic messages.
  all           Purge ALL data

status_options: |
  Show the current state of load generation across all agents. If load
  generation is currently executing on any agent, such agents are displayed.
